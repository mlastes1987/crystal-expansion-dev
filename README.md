- **3rd Page to Trainer Card for Kanto Leaders/Badges**

- **Earn EXP by catching mons**

- **Kurt makes Poke Balls instantly** Instead of waiting until the next day, a small fade to black and your Poke Ball is finished.  Unsure if this will work with the GS Ball event.

- **Restored Celebi GS Ball Event** After defeating the Elite Four and becoming Champion, fly to the Goldenrod City Pokemon Center and upon entering a nurses aide gives you the GS Ball item.  Fly to Azalea Town and give it to Kurt, the next day Kurt will tell you something strange is happening in the forest.  Go to Azalea forest and put the GS Ball inside the shrine past the cut tree.  A cutscene will happen and you'll get to fight/catch a level 70 Celebi.

- **Known Issues** Any issues found or reported will be put here until they are resolved.
